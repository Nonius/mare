Mare is a reimagining of the [Pony](https://www.ponylang.io/) language.

The goal is to create a language with all the desirable features of Pony, while simultaneously being more approachable to newcomers and more extensible for power users.

It's an early work in progress, but it can already compile and run basic programs.

Check out the [feature roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) and [goals summary](./GOALS.md) for more information on where this project is headed.
